DESCRIPTION:


TO DO:

	pyqt
		make it use pyqt instead of matplotlib
			give it display options:
				Soundwave
					make it so its not moving to the side like in the current plot but just wobbling like a string
					make y axis have amplitude in Amps (or whatever Amplitude's units ar, decibles I think)
				Frequency
					y axis notes (or Hz)
				5 line Sheet Music
				Tab

				Guitar FretBoard

				NOTE
					for frequency, 5 line sheet music, and Tab, make it so the user can control how fast the x axis (time) scrolls
						through the GUI (via a slide bar probably so that theres a max and a min)
