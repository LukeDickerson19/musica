DESCRIPTION:


TO DO:

	make basic python version of fft thing
		see sd_spectrogram.pyin old_musica/src

	migrate to c++ and port audio

	it would be cool if:
		in the soundwave chart:
			there was a title
				when the GraphicsWindow gets its own window the title appears
				but its gone when its a child of the mainwindow
			both plots appear on the same graph
				color coded with a legend
				put color codes in style sheet that could be organized as part of a theme
			you could have a checkbox for each channel, when cheched theire visable
				maybe this is in the view dropdown, and maybe its for other views too
			you could have a zoom scroll bar (modifies x_range, range: 20 to 500, default: 250)
			you could have a zoom scroll bar (modifies y_range, range: ? to ?)
			you could have a [pause] button that captures what the wave looks like when you press it


		give it display options:
			Soundwave
				make it so its not moving to the side like in the current plot but just wobbling like a string
				make y axis have amplitude in Amps (or whatever Amplitude's units ar, decibles I think)
			Frequency
				y axis notes (or Hz)
			5 line Sheet Music
			Tab

			Guitar FretBoard

			NOTE
				for frequency, 5 line sheet music, and Tab, make it so the user can control how fast the x axis (time) scrolls
					through the GUI (via a slide bar probably so that theres a max and a min)


GUI DESIGN:

	File:
		New
		Open
		Save
		Save As
		Close

	View:
		Fullscreen On/Off F11
		Number of Views > 
		Theme
			Light
			Dark
			Punk
			Pop
			Metal
			Custom

		I want to be able to control
			the number of views
			the number of instruments on each view
			the placement of the views
				stacked
					veritcal
					horizontal
				grid view
				etc.

		Sound Wave
		Piano Keys
			with options
				left (default)
				right
				top
				bottom
		Sheet Music
		Guitar Tab
		Fret Board
			left handed
			right handed (default)



	Setup:
		Interface
		Guitar Calibration

		OR I could make it have a video game style options
			Campaign
			Lessons
			Song Writing

		Basic Setup

	Sounddevice is the library used to input the raw soundwave data
		the plot_input.py example is used to capture the sound from each channel of the scarlett 2i2 interface
